<h1>This is a H1 Title</h1>

This will be fun, i'm not going to type out an entire page of content to test this,
so instead I will find a nice excerpt from the <strong>news</strong>

*Brentford climbed back to second in the Championship* as Ivan Toney's first-half penalty was enough for them to beat Blackburn.

Toney scored his 26th goal of the league campaign after Tarique Fosu was fouled by Rovers skipper [Darragh Lenihan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darragh_Lenihan) just nine minutes in.

It proved enough to win the game, although Blackburn themselves had appeals for a penalty turned down in the second half when Ryan Nyambe appeared to be fouled by Mads Sorensen.

Brentford climb to second on goal difference above both Watford and Swansea, but are 10 points behind leaders Norwich.
